# RevoU Mini Coding Project

This is my mini coding project developed as part of RevoU's Fundamental Course Software Engineering program. The project is focused on developing a simple website to apply the concepts of software engineering learned during the course by using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and functionality.
